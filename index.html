          Indian culture is the heritage of social norms and technologies that
          originated in or are associated with the ethno-linguistically diverse
          India, pertaining to the Indian subcontinent until 1947 and the
          Republic of India post-1947. The term also applies beyond India to
          countries and cultures whose histories are strongly connected to India
          by immigration, colonisation, or influence, particularly in South Asia
          and Southeast Asia. India's languages, religions, dance, music,
          architecture, food, and customs differ from place to place within the
          country.

          Indian culture, often labelled as a combination of several cultures,
          has been influenced by a history that is several millennia old,
          beginning with the Indus Valley Civilization and other early cultural
          areas.[1][2] Many elements of Indian culture, such as Indian
          religions, mathematics, philosophy, cuisine, languages, dance, music,
          and movies have had a profound impact across the Indosphere, Greater
          India, and the world. The British Raj further influenced Indian
          culture, such as through the widespread introduction of the English
          language,[3] and a local dialect developed.

          India has 28 states and 8 union territories with different cultures
          and is the most populated country in the world.[15] The Indian
          culture, often labeled as an amalgamation of several various cultures,
          spans across the Indian subcontinent and has been influenced and
          shaped by a history that is several thousand years old.[1][2]
          Throughout the history of India, Indian culture has been heavily
          influenced by Dharmic religions.[16] Influence from East/Southeast
          Asian cultures onto ancient India and early Hinduism, specifically via
          Austroasiatic groups, such as early Munda and Mon Khmer, but also
          Tibetic and other Tibeto-Burmese groups, had noteworthy impact on
          local Indian peoples and cultures. Several scholars, such as Professor
          Przyluski, Jules Bloch, and Lévi, among others, concluded that there
          is a significant cultural, linguistic, and political Mon-Khmer
          (Austroasiatic) influence on early India, which can also be observed
          by Austroasiatic loanwords within Indo-Aryan languages and rice
          cultivation, which was introduced by East/Southeast Asian
          rice-agriculturalists using a route from Southeast Asia through
          Northeast India into the Indian subcontinent. <br>
        
          
          <p class="para">This particularly concerns the spread of Hinduism, Buddhism, architecture,
          administration and writing system from India to other parts of Asia
          through the Silk Road by the travelers and maritime traders during the
          early centuries of the Common Era.[20][21] To the west, Greater India
          overlaps with Greater Persia in the Hindu Kush and Pamir
          Mountains.[22] Over the centuries, there has been a significant fusion
          of cultures between Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims, Jains, Sikhs and
          various tribal populations in India. <br>

          India is the birthplace of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, and
          other religions. They are collectively known as Indian religions.[25]
          Indian religions are a major form of world religions along with
          Abrahamic ones. Today, Hinduism and Buddhism are the world's third and
          fourth-largest religions respectively, with over 2 billion followers
          altogether,[26][27][28] and possibly as many as 2.5 or 2.6 billion
          followers. <br> Followers of Indian religions – Hindus, Sikhs,
          Jains and Buddhists make up around 80–82% population of India. India
          is one of the most religiously and ethnically diverse nations in the
          world, with some of the most deeply religious societies and cultures.
          Religion plays a central and definitive role in the lives of many of
          its people. Although India is a secular Hindu-majority country, it has
          a large Muslim population. <br>Except for Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab,
          Meghalaya, Nagaland, Mizoram and Lakshadweep, Hindus form the
          predominant population in all 28 states and 8 union territories.
          Muslims are present throughout India, with large populations in Uttar
          Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Kerala, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, West
          Bengal and Assam; while only Jammu and Kashmir and Lakshadweep have
          majority Muslim populations. Christians are other significant
          minorities of India. <br> Because of the diversity of religious groups in
          India, there has been a history of turmoil and violence between them.
          India has been a theatre for violent religious clashes between members
          of different religions such as Hindus, Christians, Muslims, and
          Sikhs. <br> Several groups have founded various national-religious
          political parties, and in spite of government policies minority
          religious groups are being subjected to prejudice from more dominant
          groups in order to maintain and control resources in particular
          regions of India.
